/**
 * Algorithm: Dice game to be played between a player and the computer
 * Human always goes first
 * Ask if the player would like to roll the dice
 * If the player enters Y, continue to roll the dice, if entered N, pass turn to the computer
 * Run a function which is the "dice", which returns a number between 1 and 6
 * If the dice ever rolls a 1 or 6, the player gets 0 points for the turn and passes the turn
 * If the dice ever rolls a 3, the player gets 15 points for the turn and passes the turn
 * If the dice rolls a 2,4, or 5, these numbers are added to the current turn total, and the player gets the option to roll the dice again
 * Repeat line 10-15 until the player either rolls a 1,3, 6, or answers N to if they would like to roll again
 * Display  the current totals of both the players and the computer and it becomes the computer's turn
 * The same number conditions defined in lines 13-15 apply
 * Roll the dice function
 * The computer will continue to roll until  it rolls a 1,3,6, or reaches a total of 10 or better
 * Display the current totals of both the players and the computer and the turn is passed back to the player
 * Repeat lines 10-21 until either the player or the computer reaches a score of at least 100
 * The player to reach that 100 first wins!
